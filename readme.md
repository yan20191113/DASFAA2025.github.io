She holds 10 patents and has 12 software copyrights.
* **Abstract**: Current limitations in machine learning reliability stem from two critical gaps: (1) the disconnection between micro data and macro knowledge, and (2) the inconsistency between machine learning paradigms and human cognitive processes. Here I present a study of machine learning by integrating cognitive mechanisms and mesoscale knowledge representation. Drawing inspiration from mesoscience principles, we develop mesoscale knowledge representations that bridge micro data and macro knowledge through causal graphs, hierarchical architectures, and enriched feature embeddings. Our approach systematically incorporates core cognitive mechanisms—including perception, memory, and attention—try to create human-aligned machine learning models. Experimental validation demonstrates the study’s effectiveness: mesoscale representations achieve 2.47% improvement in mean values of age accuracy and enable precise facial age synthesis through hierarchical causal learning. In cognitive integration tasks, we show how episodic memory-based class incremental learning maintains 74.85% average accuracy over 9 learning phases on ImageNet-100. The talk further presents practical implementations in autonomous driving, where our cognitive-mesoscale integration framework enhances success rate by 47.5% at unsignalized intersections through leveraging diminishing demonstrations in deep reinforcement learning. These advancements establish a new paradigm for developing trustworthy, biologically-inspired machine intelligence that harmonizes data-driven learning with human-like reasoning.
