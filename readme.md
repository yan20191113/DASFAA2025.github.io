## Workshop:
**The 11th International Workshop on Big Data Management and Service**


## Abstract:

The proliferation of new technologies such as Internet of things, social networks and cloud computing produces datasets whose volume, velocity, and variability are beyond the ability of commonly used software tools. Efficient processing of big data creates notable research challenges and opportunities for traditional databases and infrastructure. On the other hand, computing and software are turned into commodity services by cloud computing, so it is necessary to examine Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) from both technology and business aspects.

This workshop welcomes different kinds of papers that emphasize theoretical foundations, algorithms, systems, and applications for big data management and service. Submitted papers may address issues including big data theory, architecture, modeling, analytics, mining, business, toolkits, visualization, open platforms, applications. Papers of applied research, industrial experience reports, work-in-progress, and vision papers with different criteria for each category are also solicited.

**Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:**

* Challenges and Open Problems for Big Data Management and Service (Vision Paper)
* Big Data Theory, Modeling and Representation
* Big Data Platforms, Systems, and Architecture
* Big Data Mining and Analytics
* Distributed and Parallelized Algorithms for Big Data
* Real-time and Streaming Algorithms for Big Data
* Big Data Toolkits and Visualization
* Big Data Applications (Internet of Things, Social Networks, etc.)
* Security, Trust, and Privacy Issues in Big Data Sharing
* Delivery, Deployment, and Maintenance of Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)
* Vector Database
* Foundation Models

## Publication

DASFAA (Database Systems for Advanced Applications) is an annual international database conference, typically located in the Asia Pacific region, aimed at showcasing the state-of-the-art and the broad range of activities in database-related research and development. It provides a forum for technical presentations and discussions among database researchers, developers and users from academia, business and industry.

The 28th DASFAA conference will be held from 26-29 May 2025 in Sinapore.

Authors are invited to submit electronically original, English-language research contributions not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Accepted papers will be published by Springer as proceedings in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). All submitted papers should be Springer LNCS camera-ready format. The style files are available from Springer LNCS site. All submissions files should be in PDF formats. The length of the paper could be 10 to 15 pages. The number of pages should not exceed 15 pages. Any paper more than 15 pages will be rejected.
